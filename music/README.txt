A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/woodwork/pen/rxrLqa.

 A basic step sequencer based on [Yamaha's Tenori-On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZxNFUsu5Y). Click or drag over the squares to make music. You can export and import your creations to save them for later, or if it's verging on Mozart - share it in the comments.

**Credit** to @rileyjshaw for his clever [Sass animation grid](http://codepen.io/rileyjshaw/pen/zGnlq), to all the inspiring musical Pens recently (I'm looking at you @pixelass) and to [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/). It's amazing, use it.
